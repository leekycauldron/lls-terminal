    "summary": "\u601d\u6e90 frantically searches for his homework assignment that's due today. He looks everywhere in his bedroom but can't find it. Panicking, he asks \u601d\u742a for help. Together they retrace his steps from yesterday afternoon - checking the living room where he had a snack, the dining room where the family ate dinner, and even the backyard where he played with his toy car. \u601d\u742a teaches him that being organized is important and helps him develop a system.\n\nFinally, \u5357\u73cd calls from the kitchen - she found the homework papers mixed in with yesterday's newspapers that she was about to recycle. \u601d\u6e90 is so relieved and grateful. \u5357\u73cd gently reminds him that everything needs its proper place. \u601d\u742a suggests they make a special homework folder and designate one spot on the dining table as \u601d\u6e90's \"homework corner.\"\n\nThe episode ends with \u601d\u6e90 happily putting his completed homework in his new folder and placing it in his backpack right away. He promises to always put his homework in the same place from now on. The gentle lesson reinforces the importance of organization, responsibility, and the value of family members helping each other solve problems.",
